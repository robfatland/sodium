Consider two prisoners summoned by the warden and presented with the following chessboard-related puzzle,
with the usual caveat that should they solve it they are granted their freedom. The puzzle will be
described today and presented to be solved on the morrow. This will give the two prisoners time to 
try and devise a solution strategy. Here is the description:


Tomorrow the Prisoner 1 will enter this room by means of door A. The chessboard shown here will
be in the same location as it is now. Notice each square is in fact a lid to a small box large with
capacity enough to contain this small golden key. Tomorrow once Prisoner 1 has entered the room, I 
the warden will produce the key and conceal it in one of the chessboard square boxes. This will
happen in full view of Prisoner 1. 64 coins will then be placed on the 64 squares of the chessboard.
Each coin will be either heads-up or tails-up.


At this point Prisoner 1 will be obliged to flip one and only one of the 64 coins and replace it 
on its square. Any coin may be chosen. 


Prisoner 1 now will leave the room through door B and escorted to a waiting room. 


Prisoner 2 will now enter the room through door A. Prisoner 2 will select a square; and if the
box under that square contains the golden key then both Prisoners will be released.
