    "in model behavior.\n",

    "Model development involves a *training* phase where parameters (primarily weights\n",
    "used in weighted sums) are established. When the model is ready for use: We want to\n",
    "produce a response to an input. This process is *inferrence*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SGD makes use of first derivative only (in the Taylor series sense) and takes\n",
    "comparatively many small steps. By virtue of the *Stochastic*: it is not a precise\n",
    "but rather is more of a drunkard's walk, this being an attempt to speed things\n",
    "up even further. By comparison using Newton's method requires both the Jacobian\n",
    "(first derivative) and Hessian (second derivative) matrices and consequently takes\n",
    "larger and more precise steps towards a minimum of the cost function. However there\n",
    "is also the risk of starting out in the wrong place and winding up on a run away\n",
    "to infinity track.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast **FNN** with **RNN**: Feedforward neural networks only move information in \n",
    "the forward direction. They are trained using the (incongruously named) backpropagation\n",
    "method. Recurrent neural networks, in contrast, feature information loops or what we\n",
    "could term time-dependent feedback mechanisms, cf LSTM.\n",
